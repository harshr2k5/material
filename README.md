# Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) Prediction using ML
This project uses Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of a material based on its mechanical properties and material conditions.

Features Used:
- Young's Modulus (E)
- Shear Modulus (G)
- Poisson's Ratio (μ)
- Density (ρ)
- Yield Strength (σₛ)
- Material Conditions: predefined material processing conditions (e.g., Annealed, Quenched, Tempered).

Additionally, the model plots the stress-strain curve with approximated plastic and fracture regions.

Requirements:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Joblib
